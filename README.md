# Job Openings (1. Rust Engineer, 2. Senior React Engineer, 3. Javascript Evangelist)

We are looking for a good Rust engineer, senior React engineer and a Javascript evangelist.

## 1. **Rust Engineer bringing Smart Contracts to life**

### The Role

CosmWasm is a smart contract container written in Rust. We have a core team that have written the container and are making it accessible through javascript libraries.

You will be porting popular Ethereum contracts to CosmWasm, and defining common standards for CosmWasm such as ERC721.

In addition you will be designing and writing custom contracts from the ground up working closely with the tech and product people.

This is a fully remote role with a team dotted around Europe.

### What you bring

You have a solid track record in Rust and have a good understanding of Smart Contracts, ideally gained in Ethereum. 

You are a good communicator and fluent in English.

You are within 2 hours of Central European Time as the rest of the team are based in CET.  You are comfortable working remotely and are familiar with the toolset of a remote worker (messaging, video etc).

## 2. **Senior React Engineer**

### The Role

We are looking for a Senior React Engineer to join our team. To make blockchains accessible we need to build some stunning UIs that abstract the complexity, luckily we have built some lovely libraries to help build web apps that interact with the blockchain.
You will be working with the infrastructure team and help shape the APIs and build some cutting edge UIs to showcase the power of our smart contracts.
This is a permanent role and we want you develop and grow with us on our journey from start-up to a mature business.

### What you bring

Your profile has a strong React and Typescript track record, and you are comfortable around modern CSS and github (or gitlab). It would be really good if you have experience in React Native, but if you don’t that is okay too.
You will have had experience of leading and mentoring team members.

## 3. **Javascript Evangelist**

### The Role

We are looking for a Javascript Evangelist to join our team. We have a growing community around our blockchain that are writing smart contracts, and what we need for mass adoption is a community of web app builders to bring it to life (nobody wants to fiddle with commands in a linux shell).
You will be working with our team, both the tech people and marketing to develop workshops, build prototypes, write articles, and get the word out far and wide about our libraries making the blockchain accessible to web developers. 
We are building tools to make it simple to build web apps around our smart contracts to make them easy to use and breakdown the barriers to blockchain.
This is a permanent role, and we want you develop and grow with us on our journey from start-up to a mature business.

### What you bring

Your profile has a minimum of 2 years’ experience with hands on Javascript and Typescript, preferably in an Open Source environment. It would be brilliant if you have worked with blockchain projects, but it is not a problem if you haven’t as long as you are keen to learn. You have good spoken and written English, and if you know more languages that is a big plus.
As the role is an evangelist role, you must demonstrate that you are eager to learn new technologies and teach other developers. If you have a blog or contribute to forums that would be an advantage.
It would be nice to have experience with Tendermint or Cosmos SDK experience or past developer evangelism experience, but this is not a requirement.
