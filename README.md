# Job Openings

We are looking for a good Rust developer to write contracts and a solid frontend developer to build dApps.

**Rust Engineer bringing Smart Contracts to life**

### The Role

CosmWasm is a smart contract container written in Rust. We have a core team that have written the container and are making it accessible through javascript libraries.

You will be porting popular Ethereum contracts to CosmWasm, and defining common standards for CosmWasm such as ERC721.

In addition you will be designing and writing custom contracts from the ground up working closely with the tech and product people.

This is a fully remote role with a team dotted around Europe.

### What you bring

You have a solid track record in Rust and have a good understanding of Smart Contracts, ideally gained in Ethereum. 

You are a good communicator and fluent in English.

You are within 2 hours of Central European Time as the rest of the team are based in CET.  You are comfortable working remotely and are familiar with the toolset of a remote worker (messaging, video etc).

### How to Apply

Please send your CV, a cover letter, and a link to your GitHub profile to hr@confio.tech

### About CosmWasm

CosmWasm is a new smart contracting platform built for the cosmos ecosystem.

CosmWasm was originally prototyped by Team Gaians at the Berlin Hackatom 2019. In particular, Aaron Craelius came up with the architecture, especially avoiding reentrancy, Jehan Tremback led the rust coding, and Ethan Frey led the go side of the implementation. After the successful prototype, the Interchain Foundation provided a grant to Confio to implement a robust version that would work in an adversarial environment.

Since then CosmWasm has developed into a robust platform and has been integrated into 6 blockchains on their testnets.
The team building CosmWasm are experts in their field and have bold ambitions for the product.


**Frontend UI developer (Vue or React) bringing SmartContracts to life**


### The Role

A key role in building web applications that interact with smart contracts on the Cosmos Blockchain that run in the CosmWasm container. The groundwork has begun with the advent of CosmJS that is a nice library that interacts with the blockchain, and is being developed by Confio with contributions from the wider community.

The first steps are to build demo apps using CosmJS that interact with CosmWasm smart contracts. There is a rudimentary app in the repo htttps://github.com/CosmWasm/name-app, however, there are a bunch of ideas we have that need building such as building a frontend visualization of IBC (inter-blockchain communication) packets between chains, with the possibility of relaying them (once this logic is added to CosmJS).

Some of the longer term goals are to build production web apps for a production product based on smart contracts and developing the code into a framework that businesses could license to go to market quickly with CosmWasm.

This is a fully remote role with a team dotted around Europe.

### What you bring

You have a track record in building beautiful web apps using a modern JS framework such as Vue or React.

We are looking for solid development experience first, and if you have experience in working with smart contracts that would be fantastic but is not a prerequisite.

You are within 2 hours of Central European Time as the rest of the team are based in CET.  You are comfortable working remotely and are familiar with the toolset of a remote worker (messaging, video etc).
