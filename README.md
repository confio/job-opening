### About CosmWasm

CosmWasm is a new smart contracting platform built for the cosmos ecosystem.

CosmWasm was originally prototyped by Team Gaians at the Berlin Hackatom 2019. In particular, Aaron Craelius came up with the architecture, especially avoiding reentrancy, Jehan Tremback led the rust coding, and Ethan Frey led the go side of the implementation. After the successful prototype, the Interchain Foundation provided a grant to Confio to implement a robust version that would work in an adversarial environment.

Since then CosmWasm has developed into a robust platform and has been integrated into 6 blockchains on their testnets.
The team building CosmWasm are experts in their field and have bold ambitions for the product.
